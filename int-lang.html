Teaching Lakȟótiyapi requires decolonization of pedagogy and leaders in the revitalization of this language have incorporated traditional practices into thier teaching such as story-telling. Most importantly language learning is made to be enjoyable!</p>

                        A big part of the revitalization efforts within the Lakota language is creating a safe-space for learners where trauma is recognized and mistakes are not corrected with judgement.

                        Scotland instituted an integrated school system of Gaelic-Medium Education (GME) that starts off learners at a young age with basic level Gaelic proficiency. This gives students the option of incorporating the Gaelic language into their education. GME is available in ~60 primary schools across Scotland and has yet to be an option for every student in the Nation.
